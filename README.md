# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

An application to help remind you of what you've have planned for the day.
It tracks the date and time, and is colour-coded based on the latter.
The hours in the past are coded grey, the present hour is red, and the future hours are green.
The planner has a text box for each hour, in which you can input an event, and a save button next to it, in order to store the plans in your local storage.
